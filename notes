Look for and prune redundent assertions.

  assert(a);
  b = b + 1;
  assert(a);  // Redundent.

Identify variables that will always be in sync, such as synchronization
clocks, to constrain k-induction.

  static int a = 8;
  static int b = 7;
  ...
  if (a == 0)
    a = 10;
  else
    a--;
  ...
  if (b == 0)
    b = 10;
  else
    b--;

  implies: a == (8 - 7 + b) % 10

Identify int variables that will always be within a range,
and constrain k-induction:

    int a = 0;
    ...
    if (a < 10)
      a++;
    else
      a = 0;

    implies: a >= 0 && a < 10


Analyze loops to determine worst case iteration.

Need to model finite precision.
